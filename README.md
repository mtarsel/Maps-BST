Maps-BST
========

Implementation of Map class with Binary Search Trees.

Status:
**Does not compile**

Due to time constraints and lack of mental sanity because of minimal sleep,the
program is incomplete and not compiling.

All of the MapIterator and TreeNode operations have been implemented and are
assumed to work.

Still need to finish the following operators in Map:
1. indexing operator
2. the copy constructor for Map
3. erase(itr)
4. count is returning garbage
5. swap

Tester is not fully implemented. Current operator* will cause Segmentation
Fault.

In order to quickly find errors in Map.h, use code editor and find TODO s.
